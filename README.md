# IOTask
Write a program that will take the name of a text file as an argument,
and output a CSV file with columns:
1. Word.
2. Frequency.
3. Frequency (in %).
   
The CSV file should be ordered in descending order of frequency, i.e. most frequent words
must go at the beginning. All characters except letters and numbers are considered delimiters.
